# Broach™: Amplify Your Impact in Gender-Based Violence Case Management

## Overview

Broach™ is a platform designed to digitize and streamline case management for Gender-Based Violence (GBV) incidents. Our mission is to bridge the gap between organizations offering social support services and the individuals who need them, ensuring victims can report incidents anonymously and NGOs can respond efficiently.

**From Report to Justice - Faster.**

Broach aims to amplify the impact of organizations like FIDA by providing smarter case management solutions.

## The Problem

Current systems face significant challenges in addressing GBV:

* **Accessibility Challenges:** Survivors often struggle to access critical support services due to various barriers.
* **Awareness and Visibility:** Many survivors are unaware of available support options, leading to unreported cases.
* **Inefficient Manual Systems:** Manual reporting processes create bottlenecks, delaying justice and support.

## The Opportunity

Despite the prevalence of GBV (1 in 3 women experience violence - NDHS 2023), a significant majority of cases go unreported due to fear, stigma, and fragmented systems. Broach offers a solution to capture more of these unreported cases and improve response times.

**Key Statistics:**

* 63% of Nigerians are affected by gender-based violence (Invictus Africa).
* 72% of GBV survivors in Nigeria never report incidents (NDHS 2023).
* Globally, 150 million girls and 73 million boys are affected by GBV (USAID).

## Broach™: A Force Multiplier

Broach isn't just a tool; it's designed to significantly enhance the capabilities of organizations like FIDA, helping to bridge the gap between survivors and justice. This also allows for better demonstration of impact to donors and policymakers.

## Benefits to Partner Organizations (e.g., FIDA)

* **Enhanced Efficiency and Scalability:** Automate case management, reducing manual paperwork and administrative burdens by an estimated 40%, allowing teams to handle more cases faster.
* **Smart Matching:** Route GBV cases to specialists based on expertise and location, potentially cutting response time by 50%.
* **24/7 Reporting:** Capture an estimated 30% more unreported cases through the Broach mobile app.
* **Rural Access:** Serve hard-to-reach survivors.
* **Realtime Analytics:** Generate reports and donor metrics (e.g., FIDA resolved 80% of Broach reported cases in 30 days).
* **Evidence Tracking:** Digital documentation improves prosecution rates (e.g., timestamped incident logs, perpetrator profiles).
* **Policy Influence:** Utilize aggregated Broach data to advocate for the implementation of GBV laws.

## Pilot Program

Broach is currently in a pilot program phase. We are looking for partners like FIDA to collaborate with us to refine and implement the platform.

**Key Aspects of the Pilot Program:**

1.  **Mutual Commitment:** A signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) will establish mutual expectations for collaboration and engagement.
2.  **Confidentiality:** All feedback and insights provided by partners will remain proprietary, and sensitive information shared during development will be protected.

## Call to Action

Join our Pilot Program and help revolutionize GBV reporting and response. Pilot slots are closing soon. Reserve NOW!
